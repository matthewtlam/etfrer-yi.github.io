    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Originally, our timeline was to be divided into events of three different categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Company scandals/lawsuits</li>
      <li>Laws/regulation</li>
      <li>Technologies</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the company scandals, we were aiming for scandals that were significant, so we favored lawsuits involving big companies and big fines (millions), paying attention to class-action lawsuits where a lot of users were concered. </p>
    <p>Also, we tried to find older scandals to track how the nature of privacy-related scandals evolved over time.</p>
    <p>Finally, it is important to note that we purposefully did not include data breaches: data breaches are not always indicative of a company's unlawful/immoral data handling, since it could be the case that a well-intentioned company's data got leaked due to a hacking/cybersecurity attack </p>
    <p>Ultimately, we also found scandals that do not involve big tech, to have greater variety in our scandals.</p>
    <p>As for the laws/regulation, they were mainly U.S.-based because the scandals we found involved big tech based in the U.S.. Exceptions exist, however, such as GDPR, which has wide influence in Europe. </p>
    <p>As for the underlying technologies, they sorted themselves into three different categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>General</li>
      <li>Biometrics</li>
      <li>Location tracking</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The "General" category is meant to broadly encompass events of all kinds that are not related to "Biometrics" and "Location tracking" (e.g., "SQL database" probably plays a big role in unlawful storing of data, but it is not really worthy of mention nor deserving of its own category). </p>
    <p>It is also interesting that our project goes beyond what the course material covers, yet it is deeply linked to class concepts. Location tracking, for example, was the subject of an earlier reading in which a Catholic priest was determined to have used Grindr. Biometrics, of course, have been covered in the form of facial recognition mentioned in a variety of articles like the one on Uighurs in China or the early MIT article on Johannesburg's surveillance cameras. </p>
    <p>Ultimately, our final timeline encompasses 9 categories that are a combination of the the three original categories and the three later categories: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>General - Scandals</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Scandals</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Scandals</li>
      <br>
      <li>General - Technologies</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Technologies</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Technologies</li>
      <br>
      <li>General - Location tracking</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Location tracking</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Location tracking</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>There are a variety of conclusions that we can draw from our timeline:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A lot of scandals involving big tech and big fine are very recent, ending around 2021-2022. This is illustrated by the flurry of scandals post-2020. The emergence of major class-action lawsuits and their settlements could reflect a general trend of big tech being very loose with regards to data privacy or a trend towards tighter reins on privacy as revealed by privacy laws capable of fining such companies. </li>
      <br>
      <li>It is hard to track any real evolution of privacy-related scandals. However, especially with Gator (1999) and BonziBuddy (1997 & 2004), we have some early antecedents of data collection that seem very common today but that occurred two decades ago. Both are listed under the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section. </li>
      <br>
      <li>A surprising number of scandals are related to unlawful biometric data collection, mostly driven by Illinois' BIPA law (2008 on the timeline, "(BIOMETRIC) LAWS/REGULATION" section). Google, Snap, Tiktok, and Facebook/Meta have all been involved in biometrics related scandals where BIPA was cited (see "(BIOMETRIC) SCANDALS" section). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Cookies, originally designed with good intentions (see "(GENERAL) TECHNOLOGY" section, ~1994-1996), now are frowned upon and are gradually being deprecated and replaced (see "(GENERAL) TECHNOLOGY" section, ~2015-2022). Third-party cookies are the main culprit, with two scandals involving third-party cookies in the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section (Google (Youtube) and COPPA in 2019; Facebook & cookies in 2012). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Facebook/Meta has earned their bad reputation with respect to data/privacy management, with 4 scandals/lawsuits (Cambridge Analytica in 2014; Facebook & cookies in 2012; Facebook & biometrics in 2015; Facebook and location tracking in 2018; all listed on the timeline).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Location tracking, curiously, were found to be the topic of two lawsuits with big tech. See Google & location tracking and Facebook & location tracking, both in 2018 on the "(LOCATION TRACKING) SCANDALS" row. (Please ZOOM in to distinguish these two).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was cited in two cases, BonziBuddy (2004) and Google (Youtube) and COPPA (2019). Both are listed under the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Laws tend to be outpaced by the technology they are meant to help regulate. This is best illustrated by Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (listed under the "(GENERAL) LAWS/REGULATION" section), which was meant to help regulate government monitoring of data, but due to specific technologies being listed (wiretaps) it did nothing to prevent emails being targeted. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Laws protecting individual rights are repealed after national security crises like 9/11. This is best demonstrated through the patriot Act which destroyed precedent set by cases like Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971), Keith Case (1972) and laws such as Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (1978), all of which are listed under the "(GENERAL) LAWS/REGULATION" section. </li>
