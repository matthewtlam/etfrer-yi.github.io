    <h1>A Timeline of Privacy and Surveillance</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project seeks to extend the discussion on issues regarding privacy and surveillance in CS 492. This project highlights the evolution of privacy in the digital age using a timeline by investigating various events, technologies, and laws/regulations. With the primary events that shaped the notion of privacy, trends and insights were extracted and elaborated upon.
      The methodology of events chosen for the timeline stemmed from three different categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Company scandals/lawsuits</li>
      <li>Laws/regulation</li>
      <li>Technologies</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The scandals on the timeline focused primarily on companies that paid significant fines (often in the tens or hundreds of millions) and affected amount of users. There was also a strong focus on older scandals that emphasized the evolution of privacy and surveillance. In particular, scandals that highlighted what was legal or illegal at one point in time but later changed due to a specific case or growth of technology. There is less focus on data breaches as it does not accurately express a company's morals or legal culpability. For instance, a company may have implemented reasonable measures to protect data privacy and still fall prey to high-level cyber-security attacks that compromise privacy. </p>
    <p>In addition to focusing on big tech firms based in the U.S., a diverse range of scandals are incorporated, including those that did not involve such entities. However, given the significant presence of U.S.-based firms in our analysis, many laws and regulations are U.S.-centric. Exceptions to this rule were laws such as PIPEDA and GDPR, which respectively influence Canada and Europe. </p>
    <p>The underlying technologies behind the scandals fell into three distinct categories: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>General</li>
      <li>Biometrics</li>
      <li>Location tracking</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While the technologies behind "Biometrics" and "Location Tracking" are intuitive, the "General" category requires further explanation. For instance, in the case of a company unlawfully collecting and storing user data, the involved technologies may include an API for making a POST request, a programming language, or an SQL database. However, since these technologies are not particularly noteworthy, the "General" category encompasses a broad classification for events not related to Biometrics or Location Tracking. </p>
    <p>This project extends upon the course material about privacy and surveillance. For example, an earlier reading focused on Location Tracking, where a Catholic priest was forced to resign due to the location tracking features of  Grindr. The concerns of Biometric technology are highlighted in articles like the one on Uighurs in China or the early MIT article on Johannesburg's surveillance cameras. </p>
    <p>Finally, the timeline encompasses nine categories, which use the three categories of technologies and create subcategories using the three methodologies of chosen events: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>General - Scandals</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Scandals</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Scandals</li>
      <br>
      <li>General - Technologies</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Technologies</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Technologies</li>
      <br>
      <li>General - Location tracking</li>
      <li>Biometrics - Location tracking</li>
      <li>Location tracking - Location tracking</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There are a variety of conclusions that we can draw from our timeline:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Many scandals involving big tech with huge fines are recent, shown by the flurry of scandals post-2020. The emergence of major class-action lawsuits and their settlements could reflect general trends of big tech being very loose about data privacy or a desire for tighter reins on privacy</li>
      <br>
      <li>Many scandals stem from the unauthorized use of personal data collected by companies. Many companies fail to explicitly state the purpose of collecting personal data and lack the consent of the user to have their data collected, stored, sold.</li>
      <br>
      <li>It is hard to track any real evolution of privacy-related scandals. However, especially with Gator (1999) and BonziBuddy (1997 & 2004), there are some early antecedents of data collection that seem very common today but that occurred two decades ago. Both are listed under the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Many biometrics-related scandals occur due to infringement of Illinois' BIPA law (2008 on the timeline). Google, Snap, Tiktok, and Facebook/Meta have been involved in biometrics-related scandals (see "(BIOMETRIC) SCANDALS" section).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cookies, originally designed with good intentions (see "(GENERAL) TECHNOLOGY" section, ~1994-1996), now are frowned upon and are gradually being deprecated and replaced (see "(GENERAL) TECHNOLOGY" section, ~2015-2022). Third-party cookies are the main culprit, with two scandals involving third-party cookies in the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section (Google (Youtube) and COPPA in 2019; Facebook & cookies in 2012).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Facebook/Meta has earned a bad reputation concerning data/privacy management, with four scandals/lawsuits (Cambridge Analytica in 2014; Facebook & cookies in 2012; Facebook & biometrics in 2015; Facebook and location tracking in 2018).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Location tracking, curiously, was found to be the topic of two lawsuits with big tech. See Google & location tracking and Facebook & location tracking, both in 2018 on the "(LOCATION TRACKING) SCANDALS" row. (Please ZOOM in to distinguish these two).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was cited in two cases, BonziBuddy (2004) and Google (Youtube) and COPPA (2019). Both are listed under the "(GENERAL) SCANDALS" section.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Many laws are created to regulate technology, but laws are often outpaced by technology. This is best illustrated by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which was meant to help regulate government monitoring of data, but due to specific technologies being listed (wiretaps), it did nothing to prevent emails from being targeted.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Laws protecting individual rights are repealed after national security crises like 9/11. This is best demonstrated through the Patriot Act which destroyed precedents set by cases like Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, Keith Case and laws such as Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). </li>
